# Exam Question

## Subject Text

> Assignment name  : microshell
> Expected files   : *.c *.h
> Allowed functions: malloc, free, write, close, fork, waitpid, signal, kill, exit, chdir, execve, dup, dup2, pipe, strcmp, strncmp

## The Program
Write a program that will behave like executing a shell command

- The command line to execute will be the arguments of this program

- Executable's path will be absolute or relative but your program must not build a path (from the PATH variable for example)

- You must implement "|" and ";" like in bash
	- we will never try a "|" immediately followed or preceded by nothing or "|" or ";"

- Your program must implement the built-in command cd only with a path as argument (no '-' or without parameters)
	- if cd has the wrong number of argument your program should print in STDERR "error: cd: bad arguments" followed by a '\n'
	- if cd failed your program should print in STDERR "error: cd: cannot change directory to path_to_change" followed by a '\n' with path_to_change replaced by the argument to cd
	- a cd command will never be immediately followed or preceded by a "|"

- You don't need to manage any type of wildcards (*, ~ etc...)

- You don't need to manage environment variables ($BLA ...)

- If a system call, except execve and chdir, returns an error your program should immediatly print "error: fatal" in STDERR followed by a '\n' and the program should exit

- If execve failed you should print "error: cannot execute executable_that_failed" in STDERR followed by a '\n' with executable_that_failed replaced with the path of the failed executable (It should be the first argument of execve)

- Your program should be able to manage more than hundreds of "|" even if we limit the number of "open files" to less than 30.

## Example

for example this should work:
```
$>./microshell /bin/ls "|" /usr/bin/grep microshell ";" /bin/echo i love my microshell
microshell
i love my microshell
$>

>./microshell 
```

## Hints
- Don't forget to pass the environment variable to execve
- Do not leak file descriptors!

	(void)argc;

    	argv += i + 1;
    	i = 0;

    	while (argv[i] && strcmp(argv[i], "|") && strcmp(argv[i], ";"))

    	if (i)
			status = exec(argv, i, envp);
    }
    return status;
